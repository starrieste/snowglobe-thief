# Snowglobe Thief

# STORY

You are Krampus! Santa claus's demon companion!
You are feeling a bit bored, so you decided to go and steal all of santa's snowglobes for fun!
Unfortunately, the elves are guarding stuff, so it may be harder than you thought!

# INFO

The plan folder is where I was planning my game, and sketched stuff out when I needed it.
The scrap folder is where I put the assets I removed, but might use again just in case (I didn't use it again).
The data folder is where all the images and the data that I AM using are.

If you have any problems running the game, please message me!
It may be a bit laggy (or at least I experienced some), I don't have the time to figure out why.

Please do not try to open the maps in the data/maps folder!
Instead, use the editor.py file. Open it in your text editor, and change the LOAD_FILE variable
to match which level you would like to open. Run it after changing.

The editor:
- WASD to pan
- Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to zoom in/out

Parts of my code is heavily inspired by / completely written by DaFluffyPotato (my idol for gamedev at the moment).
His website: https://dafluffypotato.com/
Where I got it from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww&t=17s

What I DIDN'T write by myself:
- I didn't come up with ANY of the code in data/scripts/utils.py
- I didn't come up with MOST of the code in data/scripts/tilemap.py
- I didn't come up with the text function in data/scripts/text.py, I did make the MLText function, although I didn't use that function...
- I didn't come up with data/scripts/animation.py, I edited it to suit my needs.
- I didn't come up with HALF of the code in editor.py
Everything else is written by me.

Also note, I didn't blindly copy paste anything, I adapted everything to suit my needs.
